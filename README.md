# Stats 140XP Project

To recreate the data, please download and run the R script files. All data sources (URLs) should be listed in the script files as comments.

The (in-progress) final data set (final_data_ip.csv) can also be accessed directly by downloading it from this repo.

Note: We will likely add demographic variables by zipcode (in-progress).
