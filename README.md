## Stats 140XP Project

To recreate the data, please download and run the R script files. All data sources (URLs) should be listed in the script files as comments. The (in-progress) final data set (final_data_ip.csv) can also be accessed directly by downloading it from this repo.

Next steps (Friday): 
- Add Census Bureau demographic variables by zipcode
- EDA

Note: I downloaded all the data and organized them into a data folder within the R project. As such, you may need to revise some of the code if you run it on your own computer. Let me know if I can clarify any component.
